# Code Habit – Day 1 & Day 2

This is a small JavaScript project created to build consistency and strengthen my core frontend fundamentals.

## What the project does
- Takes text input from a textarea
- Counts total characters (including spaces)
- Counts total words accurately
- Allows resetting the input and counts using a button

## Features
- Live character count
- Live word count
- Reset button to clear text and counters

## Why this project exists
I am focusing on daily progress instead of overthinking.
This project is part of my habit to code consistently after office hours and build real, working things.

## Progress log
