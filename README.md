# Code Habit – Day 1, Day 2 & Day 3

This is a small JavaScript project created to build consistency and strengthen my core frontend fundamentals through daily practice.

## What the project does
- Takes text input from a textarea
- Counts total characters (including spaces)
- Counts total words accurately
- Allows resetting the input and counts using a button
- Calculates estimated reading time

## Features
- Live character count
- Live word count
- Reading time calculation
- Reset button to clear text and counters

## Why this project exists
I am focusing on real, consistent progress instead of overthinking.
This project is part of my daily habit to code after office hours and improve my understanding of JavaScript, logic, and DOM manipulation.

This repository represents learning, discipline, and steady growth starting from zero.
